            In the past 20 years, people are facing lots of health issues, because of consuming food with high chemical content. Many big food companies add chemicals that are harmful to human health in the food, especially in daily needs like sugar, rice, etc...to preserve them. This will reduce the lifespan of the people. Let's give a better and healthy lifestyle to the next generation. Also, we wanted to extend our support to the end level farmers, so we cultivate direct from the farms.  

            "Though India exports organic products to most of the countries in the world, We stand in 120th place in the World's Healthiest Countries, among 160 countries", says <strong>WHO [ World Health Organization].</strong> 
            
            When we saw these kinds of reports from a reputed organization like WHO, we were disturbed about the reality and wanted to contribute something for the society as well as the country. 
            
            That's why we started an initiate to provide quality and chemical free goods to the people at lowest prices in the market.
