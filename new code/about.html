            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
             when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
             into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
             passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h1>Why You Choose Our Sugar Products?</h1>

<div class="secondcontent">

<p>                             
    Sugar plays a major role in our body as well as in our day-to-day life. No one in this world hates sugar. But in recent times, sugar has become a life threat for people. 

    Even new born babies are suffering from Diabetes Mellitus. This is because of presence of chemicals in our foods. Doctors suggest using jaggery and country sugar instead of crystalized white sugar to avoid diabetes and bone related diseases. 
    
    <strong>From children to old people, anyone can consume Palm Sugar, Country Sugar, Country Jaggery, Palm Jaggery, and honey without any hesitation.</strong> They don't have any side effects. 
    
    Let me share with the story behind the manufacturing of white sugar to the white sugar users: 
    
    To crystalized the white sugar and improve its white color, many sugar manufacturers add the below chemicals while manufacturing them. 

</p>

</div>

<h3>Those chemicals are:</h3>

<div class="keypoints">

<ol>Calcium hypo-chloride</ol>
<ol>Polyelectrolyte</ol>
<ol>So2 - Sulfur dioxide</ol>
<ol>Phosphoric acid</ol> 
<ol>Hydrated lime</ol>

</div>

<div class="secondcontenta">

<p> Sulfur dioxide is one of the harmful chemicals that can cause adverse effects on human health. It affects the respiratory system, particularly the lungs, and can cause irritation to eyes. Sulfur dioxide will irritate the respiratory tract and increases the risk of infections on wind pipe. It causes coughing, mucus secretion and aggravates conditions such as asthma and chronic bronchitis.
    
    Import of Indian white sugar is banned in the US and UK. Because in Indian white sugar has 70ppm So2, but the US and UK white sugar contains only 10ppm S02. 
    
    Nearly 75 million people are suffering from diabetes all over the world. In that 1 among each 6 people are from India. The saddest part is, nowadays many youngsters are suffering from diabetes, which can continue generations after generations. We all know that Diabetes can also lead to other health complications related to the heart, kidney, and more. As sugar has dissolved in our daily life, we cannot avoid using it. But be cautious, which sugar you're using.
